# battle-tank-game
Training project using Unity's Battle Tank base artwork
This project was made as a part of learning at Outscals FSGD program.
The main focus of the project is to implement the GAME DESIGN PATTERNS.
The Game is made for ANDROID build, and thus supports touch controls.
# Design Patterns Used
1. Singleton Pattern : THis Pattern was used in order to maintain single instance of some game objects such as Services and managers.
2. Observer Pattern : THis was used in order to operate the UI system independent of the character or enemy.
3. State MAchine : Enemy AI is implemented using the state machine which is modular in nature and could be improved much better.
4. MVC Pattern : In order to make the CHaracter creation and impleentation Easier the MVC Patterns being used.
5. Scriptable Objects : The Enemy or player will be modular and could be changed or managed using these scriptable objects thus making the same code reuseable and Modular.
6. Object Pool : The enemies are being generated in waves so the Object pool is being used to  manage the spawning and destruction of the enemies.
# New Concepts Learned
1. Coroutines :In order to perform some time related functionalities coroutines were used.
2. Async Await : along with coroutine implementation of async await is also learnt.
3. Game Design Patterns were used in order to make rhobust and modular.
4. Unity AI and Nav Mesh was also implemented.
5. Use of touch input system was also made.
